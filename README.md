Hi, I'm Dima Salem a Passionate programmer committed to continuous learning.

In today's lecture, I learned about several new and important topics such as:

- The difference between GUI and CLI:

  - GUI (Command Line Interface): is a visual way for users to interact with a computer system using graphical elements.

  - CLI (Command Line Interface): is a way to relate on command written by a user to make specific interactions with a computer system.

- Basic terminal command:

  - cd: change directory

    - cd ..: Navigate to the directory above the current one
    - cd ~: Navigate to your home directory
    - cd path: Navigate to a specific directory path

  - ls: List directory contents
  - pwd: Print working directory path
  - mkdir: Make a directory
  - rmdir: Remove a directory
  - touch: Create an empty file

- Concept of VCS: The system tracks changes made to files over time, allowing teams to collaborate effectively, revert to previous versions if needed, and maintain a record of project history.

- Git & Git commands: it is a VCS

  - git init: Initialize a new Git repository
  - git clone: Clone a repository from a remote URL to your local machine.
  - git add: Add changes to the staging area.
  - git commit: Commit changes to the repository.
  - git pull: Fetch changes from a remote repository and merge them into the current branch.
  - git push: Push local changes to a remote repository.

- Github: is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories, allowing users to store, share, and collaborate on code and project files.

- Markdown language: it is a language that provides a simple and easy-to-read syntax for formatting plain text documents like README file.

this is a test
